#### Disclaimer: I used chatGPT to help me complete parts of this assignment, it was very helpful with getting me started, connecting to mongo, redis, etc, and helping me with syntax errors. I also had it help me with some general structural questions about how to approach the queries as I was still learning, and it was helpful for the simple stuff, which helped me become more self sufficient as I went through the other work. It also helped me troubleshoot when I ran into some unexpected errors surrounding the redis js syntax.
